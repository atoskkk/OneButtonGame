This project was made by a Game Design first year student
The goal of this exercice is to be able to create a game only by using one button
Mainly, our objective here is to create fun during the gameplay and a decent feedback when it comes to the interaction between the player and the inputs

!!! IMPORTANT !!!
THIS GAME IS ONLY PLAYED WITH THE SPACEBAR
Use the Arrows to navigate in the menu, spacebar to continue/accept and ESC to go back.
